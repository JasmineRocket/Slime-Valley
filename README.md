# Slime-Valley

*** Project's Name and Short Description ***

The project “Slime Valley” is a sandbox game. The player would play the role of a space traveler who crash-landed in Slime Valley, ranching slimes and earning money, buying parts to rebuild the rocket, and eventually return to the space to continue his journey. During the game, the player would need to capture and ranch different kinds of slimes from the wild, collect the slime crystals they produce, and sell these crystals to earn money. The interesting part of the game is it allows player to hybrid slimes to make new species of slimes (which also produce more expensive crystals), and to sell the crystals at the best deal (price of each crystal fluctuates every day).
